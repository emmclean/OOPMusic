//If finalNote method could not lead to display method but isntead, Display method recieved noteDuration and noteType, that would be awesome.

//I do not know how we will deal with placing on the x axis yet. The display method might need to look at the array, and the note's place in the array to determine that.

public class DisplayNote{
//Rest Method
//if noteDuration= rest
//call LoadRightNoteApp

//Repeat this for Quarter, Half, and Whole Method

//Currently working on figuring out how to manifest an image on another image


public static void main (String[] args){
int noteDuration = Integer.parseInt(args[0]);
int noteType = Integer.parseInt(args[1]);
}
}
